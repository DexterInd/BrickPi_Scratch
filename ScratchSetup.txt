As of May 2014, the latest Dexter Industries image will have these changes already made.  You can download the latest image from our website.

The BrickPi Python and Scratch interfaces are available as a Python module. To install both interfaces, together with their dependencies, open a terminal window and type:

sudo apt-get install -y python-serial \
python-setuptools python-dev
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install BrickPi

To use the serial port to communicate with the BrickPi, it has to be available as an input/output (I/O) connection. To allow a connection using the serial bus, the Raspbian configuration needs to be changed slightly. 

Type:
sudo - s
Then use the nano editor to edit
/boot/confi g. txt:
nano /boot/config. txt
Go to the end of the file and add:
init_uart_cl ock=32000000

Then save this file and open /etc/inittab. Find
T0: 23
and put a # character in front, to comment it out.
Then save it. 

Next, open /boot/cmdline.txt and
remove
console=ttyAMA0, 115200kgdboc=ttyAMA0, 115200

and save the file. Now reboot the Raspberry Pi.
